# 🧠 Teen Slang Translator (Gen Alpha Edition)

Like many of us, I sometimes hear phrases like “what the sigma” or “it’s so cra cra” and wonder… what are the kids really saying?

### ✨ Features

- 🔁 **Translate both ways**:
  - “I did well on my test” ➡️ “I totally grinded and aced my test!”
  - “That was light work, no cap” ➡️ “It was really easy, seriously!”

- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Designed for parents & kids** to explore language together
- 🎓 Fun, safe, and educational — powered by OpenAI
