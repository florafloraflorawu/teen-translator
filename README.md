# 🧠 Teen Slang Translator (Gen Alpha Edition)

This fun and educational web app uses AI to translate **regular English into modern teen slang** (Gen Alpha-style) — and vice versa!

Built by a mom of two (ages 10 and 13), this translator helps parents and educators understand the wild, creative language of today’s tweens and teens. 🧒💬👩‍🏫

### ✨ Features

- 🔁 **Translate both ways**:
  - “I did well on my test” ➡️ “I totally grinded and aced my test!”
  - “That was light work, no cap” ➡️ “It was really easy, seriously!”

- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Designed for parents & kids** to explore language together
- 🎓 Fun, safe, and educational — powered by OpenAI
